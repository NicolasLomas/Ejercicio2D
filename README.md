# Ejercicio2D
Very simple 2D game to practice changing scenes, with a simple character he moves left and right, jumps and shoots, including a shooting animation, when approaching the edge of scene 1, depending on the edge, he loads scene 2 or scene 3 and As the discharge moves away, the arrows of the shot when hitting the targets add points and when all the targets are finished or time runs out, the game ends, indicating the score and the remaining time on the final screen in case it has not finished.
